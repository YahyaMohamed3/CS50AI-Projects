# Attention

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a neural attention mechanism for natural language processing tasks. The attention model selectively focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating the output, which enhances the performance of tasks like translation and text generation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run python attention.py to test the attention mechanism.
